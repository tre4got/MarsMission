{"name":"Mission to Mars A Genetic Approach to Building Teams","tagline":"A.I. to select colonists for Mars","body":"# The How\r\nThis Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) will generate 25 teams of 100 people, from a set of 10,000 candidates, for a mission to colonize Mars. The A.I. makes use of a genetic algorithm to build and score potential teams. The algorithm maintains a population size of 100 teams. Each iteration of the algorithm will be referred to as a generation. Each generation will go through several stages:\r\n\r\n* Fitness\r\n* Purge\r\n* Reproduction\r\n* Mutation\r\n\r\n## Fitness\r\nIn the Fitness stage each team in the population will be scored. Teams are scored based on the technical skills of the individual team members as well as the personality types within each team. \r\n### Technical Skills\r\nTechnical skills will be scored based on the necessity of the skill along with the demand for that skill. For example if there are already 10 Structural Engineers on the team having more would be a burden to the team so additional Structural Engineers will contribute less, or even contribute negatively, to the overall teams score. Right now the only hard requirements for technical skills are that each team must have at least one Doctor and one Psychiatrist. \r\n### Personality Types\r\nPersonality types will be determined by the Myers Briggs Test. The Myers Briggs Test will assign an individual one of 16 possible personality types and with each of those personalities there are a few other personalities they get along well with, and some that they get along poorly with (http://pstypes.blogspot.com/2009/03/myers-briggs-compatibility-part-1.html). Using this information each candidate will be assigned a personality type. Teams will increase their score if they have a large number of people whose personalities work well together and will decrease their score if a large number of people don't work well together. The only hard requirement for personality types is that each team must have a leader, this means at least one member of the team needs to have a personality type of ENTJ (https://www.saybrook.edu/rethinkingcomplexity/posts/08-11-14/what-personality-types-support-good-leadership).\r\n\r\n## Purge\r\nDuring the Purge stage all teams with a negative score, meaning the team has zero chance of survival, will be removed from the population. After all negative scores have been removed the algorithm will start removing teams with the lowest scores. The algorithm will purge at least 20% of the population and at most 60%.\r\n\r\n## Reproduction\r\nThe reproduction stage will replace all the teams we lost to the purge stage with new teams created from a mix of 2 other teams. Each member of the child team is selected from 2 parent teams. \r\n\r\n## Mutation\r\nIn the mutation stage 20 individuals are chosen from each team in the population and they are each given a 10% chance to mutate. The mutation is to simply replace that person with another random from the original candidate list. \r\n\r\n# The Why\r\nSelecting 100 people for a mission to colonize Mars is a daunting task. The exhaustive method would be to select several hundred people and put them through rigorous and prolonged testing and slowly weed people until only 100 are left. By using this A.I. you will be presented with a smaller subset of possible teams that are already optimized. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
